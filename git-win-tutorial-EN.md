In my opinion, for beginners who have no experience about coding, this tutorial just aimed to teach you about how to commit things to github. You will have nothing to be edit.

For experience developers who just want to learn how to use git & github as a tool to do version control, I believe Vim is not a big issue. The difference between vim and other text editor is, you need to start editing by pressing **i** on your keyboard, and stop editing by pressing **Esc** . To save edited text and quit vim, type **:wq** . Other shortcuts like ```Ctrl+C```, ```Ctrl+V```, ```Ctrl+X``` are exactly the same as other text editors.
